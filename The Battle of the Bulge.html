      <h1>The Battle of the Bulge</h1>
      <h2>
        The Battle of the Bulge, also known as Hitler's final gamble in Western Europe was a ferocious Counter-attack that <br> took place in the snowy forests of Bastogne. The attack was spearheaded by three Panzer enormous armies.  The Allies quickly found themselves unprepared and ill-equiped. As the battle raged on across Ardennes, it was left to a few U.S Infantry Divisions to hold the Alied lines.
